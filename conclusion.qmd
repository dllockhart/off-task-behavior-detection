## Summary
The Random Forest model achieved a Cohen Kappa Score of 0.49, showing moderate agreement between predictions and actual observations. 

### Future Work
- Use SMOTE for class imbalance correction.
- Experiment with more complex models (XGBoost, LSTM).
- Incorporate more features and fine-tune hyperparameters.
